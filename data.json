Always remember in the jungle there’s a lot of they in there, after you overcome they, you will make it to paradise. To succeed you must believe. When you believe, you will succeed. You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. Bless up. The key is to drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust me. Egg whites, turkey sausage, wheat toast, water. Of course they don’t want us to eat our breakfast, so we are going to enjoy our breakfast.",
